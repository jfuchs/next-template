# Next template

some stuff I like 90% of the time I start a react app:

- next.js (started with create-next-app)
- tailwindcss ([see also](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs))
- prettierrc (but no prettier in the package)
- support for absolute paths (e.g., `@/src/components/app`)
- folder structure with `components`, `hooks`, & `pages` inside `src/`
- an `App` component and a `useAppState` hook
- some placeholder business logic
- TypeScript
- Jest

## Things I might want to do

- eslint with some reasonable rules

## Howto

- `git clone` this repo
- `git remote remove origin`
- Update the package name in `package.json`
- Update this README to something reasonable
